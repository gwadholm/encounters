Those abilities are in 3 main categories: vision, motor skills and memory and thinking skills.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>As a license office employee you may be the <b> <i>first<\/i> <\/b>professional to identify an impairment related to driving safety and ability. This training will review the signs and symptoms of common medical conditions that may affect a person\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.<\/p> <p>Keep in mind that medical conditions can involve symptoms that may vary from minor to severe. Many people are unaware that they have a certain medical condition. Others may be in denial that a condition could affect driving.<\/p> <p>Since everything we do is connected to our brain, many medical conditions affect different areas of our body. For example a stroke can affect an applicant\u2019s vision, motor skills, and\/or memory. Dementia (meaning memory and\/or thinking problems that impair function) can affect an applicant\u2019s ability to follow simple directions, reaction time (like moving a foot from the gas to the brake pedal) and\/or the ability to recognize and understand road signs.<\/p> <p>You do not need medical training to watch for impairments as applicants move through the licensing process. Many signs and symptoms of medical conditions can be observed when an applicant participates in tasks like walking to the counter, exchanging information with you, or taking a licensing test.<\/p> <p> <strong>Goal:&nbsp;<\/strong>To know the visible symptoms of medical impairments that may make an applicant unsafe behind the wheel.<\/p> <p>4 modules give training on different parts of the licensing process. Each module includes:<\/p> <ul> <li>a brief lesson<\/li> <li>a video example<\/li> <li>a&nbsp;quiz<\/li> <\/ul> <p>After successfully completing the 4 quizzes (score of 70% or better) you will receive a certificate of completion for printing or saving. You may retake the quizzes, and you will be able to login and save your progress if you are unable to finish in one sitting.<\/p> <br class=\"clear\"> <div class=\"homeModule\" id=\"homeWalking\"> <a href=\"\/1\/1\"><img src=\"\/img\/walking.png\" style=\"width: 96px; height: 97px; opacity: 1;\" alt=\"Feet walking\"><\/a> <h2>Module 1: Walking to the Counter<\/h2> <p>Walking in the license office, getting up from a chair, or approaching the counter.<\/p> <a href=\"\/1\/1\" class=\"lessonBtn\">Begin Lesson<\/a> <\/div> <div class=\"homeModule\" id=\"homeInformation\"> <a href=\"\/2\/1\"><img src=\"\/img\/information.png\" style=\"width: 96px; height: 97px; opacity: 1;\" alt=\"Arrows symbolizing information flow back and forth\"><\/a> <h2>Module 2: Exchanging Information<\/h2> <p>When an applicant is talking with DMV staff, filling out forms, providing required information, and paying fees.&nbsp;<\/p> <a href=\"\/2\/1\" class=\"lessonBtn\">Begin Lesson<\/a> <\/div> <div class=\"homeModule\" id=\"homeVision\"> <a href=\"\/3\/1\"><img src=\"\/img\/vision.png\" style=\"width:96px;height: 97px;\" alt=\"A blue eye wide open\"><\/a> <h2>Module 3: Testing<\/h2> <p>The ability to visually recognize, understand and interpret information from the environment while driving is essential.&nbsp;<\/p> <a href=\"\/3\/1\" class=\"lessonBtn\">Begin Lesson<\/a> <\/div> <div class=\"homeModule\" id=\"homeReporting\"> <a href=\"\/4\/1\"><img src=\"\/img\/reporting.png\" style=\"width: 96px; height: 97px; opacity: 1;\" alt=\"An official document\"><\/a> <h2>Module 4: State Reporting<\/h2> <p>How to report possible medical impairments<\/p> <a href=\"\/4\/1\" class=\"lessonBtn\">Begin Lesson<\/a> <\/div> <br class=\"clear\">"}
