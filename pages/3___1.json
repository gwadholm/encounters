If the person has severe arthritis or an injury affecting  their neck, they may have limited ability to move their head and neck.<\/p> <p>When it comes to driving, a person needs to be able to scan their environment  by freely moving their head and neck from side to side frequently. &nbsp;<\/p> <p>  <br> <\/p> <h3>Thinking\/Memory Problems<\/h3> <p>Sometimes when an applicant is unable to read the road signs correctly,  they may have a medical condition that impacts their memory and thinking  skills like dementia or a stroke.
